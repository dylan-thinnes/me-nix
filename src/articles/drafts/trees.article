Trees
Dylan Thinnes
I think that I shall never see...

I think that I shall never see
A program as lovely as a tree

A tree that can, when parsing's past,
Represent abstract syntax.

Or which when laziness permits,
Computes recursive program bits.

A tree of which base functor claims,
Its fixpoint is the very same.

And thus whose catamorph collapse,
Is stepped along by pattern match.

Programs are made by fools like me,
But only good can come of trees.
