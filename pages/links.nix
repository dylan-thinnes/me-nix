        Peter Watts is the harshest, bleakest scifi author I've ever read. He
        especially loves beating you over the head with your general insignificance on
        a cosmic scale and your eventual obsolescence as we enter the century of
        singularities & killer robots. Good stuff!

        This is a backlist he keeps of some of his works and short stories, free to
        read! I particularly enjoyed "The Island", for which he won the Hugo Award.

        Many people are familiar with the concept of "six degrees of separation",
        derived from renowned psychologist Stanley Milgram's finding that Americans are
        separated by (on average) 6 social links.<br/><br/>

        The experiment's methodology is amusing enough to link here, it's a very simple
        solution to what seems a complex problem in experimental design. A following
        section on the page, <b>Criticisms</b>, is also a cool read that covers the
        flaws in this delightfully simple solution.
